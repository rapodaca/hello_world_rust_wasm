# Hello World with Rust and WebAssembly

This projects demonstrates two-way string passing between JavaScript and a WebAssembly instance compiled from Rust. Only the standard library is used. wasm-bindgen is not needed.

The intent is to document with working code string message passing to help evaluate the need for more advanced tooling.
